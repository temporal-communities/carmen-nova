# _Carmen Nova_ HTML Representation

This directory contains code to render the HTML version of Carmen Nova from TEI XML using [CETEIcean](https://github.com/TEIC/CETEIcean/).

## Usage

Launch your preferred local web server from the project root directory (`..` from here).

For example, using Python:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

Then, navigate to the `web/` directory in your browser, e.g. http://localhost:8000/web/.

This development mode is automatically recognised and will load your local copy of the TEI file.
You can ensure you are running in development mode by checking your browserâ€™s development console. You should see a message like:

```
ðŸš§ Development mode: Using local XML file.
```
